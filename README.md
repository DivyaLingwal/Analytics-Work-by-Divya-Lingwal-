1. Time series forescasting: Project on Descriptive analysis of effect of September 11,2001 on Air,Vehicle and Train Travel: Having both the data pre-Sept 11 and Post Sept 11, I first forecasted the travel after Sept 11 and then compared it with actual Travel pattern.
Result: Significant drop in Air Travel after Sept 11, while there was no effect on Train travel. Vehicle travel was affected slightly during September 2011. 
Key Highlights: Had Additive seasonility, Analyzed all the components of TS, Suppresed seasonality to clearly visualize the pattern,Checked staionarity of TS.
